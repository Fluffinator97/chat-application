## Information Back-End
This Readme here includes information about our server side.

## Install dependencies
We used a lot of different dependencies such as [nodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), [express](https://expressjs.com/), [nodemon](https://nodemon.io), [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) and [socket.io](https://socket.io/) You can install all of these by typing npm i in the console. But first you need to make sure that you are inside the server folder. You can navigate to the server folder by using cd server.

## How to run the server
When you are inside the server folder run nodemon server.js, it will start up the server for our chat application.
